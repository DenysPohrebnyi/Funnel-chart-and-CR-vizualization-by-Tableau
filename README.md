## Project Stages

1. Business Understanding & Requirements
   - Defined the funnel stages with the client (e.g., App Opened → Sign-Up → Set Goal → Enable Notifications → Start First Workout).
   - Aligned on KPIs: conversion rates, drop-off percentages, and total user flow.

2. Data Preparation
   - Cleaned raw CSV data: standardized stage names, parsed timestamps, removed duplicates.
   - Restructured dataset for funnel analysis with unique user paths across defined stages.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Calculated stage-to-stage conversion and drop-off rates.
   - Identified highest friction points in the funnel (notably, "Enable Notifications" and "Start First Workout").
   - Segment-based analysis by platform (iOS/Android).

4. Visualization
   - Built a step-by-step interactive funnel in Tableau.
   - Added filters by device type and cohort date to allow dynamic exploration.

5. Insights & Recommendations
   - Identified that the largest user drop-off occurred between goal setting and notification opt-in.
   - Recommended A/B testing for opt-in screen design and making first workout content more accessible.
